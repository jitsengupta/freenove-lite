This repository is a reduced version of the original Freenove 4WD smart car code, originally posted at

https://github.com/Freenove/Freenove_4WD_Smart_Car_Kit_for_Raspberry_Pi

and additional updates and ports by @amdroid0007, at

https://github.com/amdroid007/freenove

I am rebuilding this as a reduced set of server-side code that a beginner Python programmer can access and 
use to use code to make the robot perform tasks such as forward, backward, turn, lights, LED show, buzzer

and with amdroid007's upgrades, use the robotarm, headlight, taillight extensions to perform additional tasks.
